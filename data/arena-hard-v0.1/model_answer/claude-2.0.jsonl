As you move away from the hole, the field lines will bend to become more tangential to the sphere.\n\n- The strength of the vector field can vary spatially across the sphere.

Convert the input image to a linear RGB color space. This avoids issues with gamma correction.\n\n2. For each pixel:\n   - If the alpha channel value is 0 (fully transparent), skip to the next pixel.\n   - Extract the RGB values.\n   - Calculate the pixel's distance in RGB space from the known chroma color. A simple Euclidean distance works well.\n   - If the distance is below a threshold, the pixel likely contains spill. Desaturate the RGB values by some amount based on the distance (e.g. closer distances desaturate more).\n   - Optionally, also darken the pixel based on distance to suppress spill further.\n   - Set the desaturated RGB values back into the image.\n\n3. Convert the image back to the original color space.\n\nThe key parameters to tune are the spill distance threshold and the desaturation/darkening curves based on distance. The threshold controls which pixels are considered spill. The desaturation/darkening curves control how strongly the spill is reduced. Tuning these parameters per setup can give good spill suppression while maintaining details.\n\nThis approach is simple and fast enough to run in real-time.

A higher wattage PSU would be better if you can upgrade.\n\n- Physical Installation - Shut down and unplug the computer. Open the case and locate an open PCIe x16 slot. Remove any bracket covering the slot. Gently insert the GPU into the PCIe slot and secure with a screw. Ensure the card is fully seated in the slot. Connect any PCIe power cables from the PSU to the GPU.\n\n- Software Installation - Boot into Linux and install the latest Nvidia drivers for your distro. For Ubuntu/PopOS, use the Additional Drivers utility. For Arch, install the nvidia or nvidia-lts package. The drivers will detect and configure the new GPU automatically. \n\n- Configuration - In Nvidia X Server Settings, you can configure the GPU for compute or graphics workloads. Set power management mode to \"Prefer Maximum Performance\" for gaming. The GPU should now be ready for use.\n\n- Testing - Run glxgears to verify 3D acceleration is working. Benchmark the card and run some games to ensure it performs as expected. Monitor system temperatures and stability.\n\nLet me know if you have any other questions!

Make sure you have sufficient data across a wide range of prices.\n\n- Visualize the data by plotting price on the x-axis and sales volume or profit on the y-axis. Look for parabolic patterns that indicate an optimal price point that maximizes profit.\n\n- Conduct regression analysis to fit curves to the data. Try quadratic/polynomial regression to model the parabolic relationship between price and profit.\n\n- The profit function can be modeled as Profit = Revenue - Cost. Revenue is modeled as Price x Volume Sold. Cost may be fixed or variable. Plot different cost scenarios.\n\n- Use cross-validation techniques to assess how well the model fits unseen data. A model that overfits will not generalize well to new pricing data.\n\n- Once you have a model that fits well, you can use it to predict profit at different price points. Identify the price that maximizes predicted profit.\n\n- Run sensitivity analysis to understand how the optimal price changes based on cost assumptions or other factors. Build a dashboard to allow dynamic pricing simulations.\n\n- Implement A/B testing to validate model predictions in the real world before rolling out new pricing. Monitor model performance over time and re-train as needed based on new data.\n\nThe key steps are gathering sufficient relevant data, identifying parabolic relationships, fitting appropriate regression models, validating predictions, and continuously monitoring and improving the model.

The regulations demonstrate valid concerns around data privacy, algorithmic bias, and AI safety - concerns that are not yet fully addressed. Implementing AI pervasively into daily life before resolving these issues could have serious consequences that undermine European principles.

I agree we should avoid falling behind in AI development. But leading requires ethics as much as innovation. Thoughtful deployment as you suggest is ideal - but difficult to guarantee today.

AI methods such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, and robotics have shown promise for improving clinical decision-making, administrative workflows, patient monitoring and engagement, and medical interventions (Topol, 2019).  \n\nOne major application of AI is in assisting with clinical decision support and diagnostics. Machine learning methods can be trained on large datasets of medical images, electronic health records, and other clinical data to develop algorithms that can predict disease, suggest appropriate treatments, and flag potential risks (Esteva et al., 2019). For example, deep learning models have been developed that can analyze retinal images for signs of diabetic retinopathy and skin images for melanoma with performance comparable to human specialists (De Fauw et al., 2018; Haenssle et al., 2018). AI diagnostic tools have the potential to expand access to expert-level analysis.\n\nAI also shows promise for improving hospital administrative processes and workflows. Algorithms can extract and structure unstructured data from medical records, claims forms, and clinician notes to automate tasks like coding, billing, and quality reporting (Spasic et al., 2020). Chatbots and virtual assistants that use natural language processing can help patients schedule appointments, provide medication reminders, or answer common medical questions, freeing up staff time (Laranjo et al., 2018). \n\nFor patient monitoring and engagement, AI enables more continuous assessment. Machine learning models can analyze data streams from wearable devices and sensors to identify deviations from normal health patterns and alert clinicians (Clifton et al., 2020). AI chatbots and avatar applications can engage patients in their care plans and promote medication adherence through conversational interfaces (Bickmore et al., 2018).\n\nFinally, AI techniques like robotics, computer vision, and haptics are being incorporated into smart surgical systems, prosthetics, and assistive robots to enhance medical interventions. These technologies can compensate for natural limitations in human abilities, leading to improvements in accuracy, efficiency, and accessibility of healthcare procedures (Tam et al., 2021).\n\nHowever, there are also challenges around transparency, ethics, and adoption of AI in healthcare that must be addressed through further research and regulatory frameworks (Wiens et al., 2019). Overall, AI has diverse applications throughout the patient care pathway with the potential to transform medical practice.", "token_len": 505}]}], "tstamp": 1713379509.9470224}

It is used to verify the integrity and authenticity of a message. \n\nThe HMAC algorithm involves the following steps:\n\n1. The secret key (K) is combined with inner and outer padding constants using XOR operations. These padding constants are fixed values defined by the HMAC specification.\n\n2. The padded key is concatenated with the message (M) and hashed using a cryptographic hash function (H) like SHA-256. This produces an intermediate hash value. \n\n3. The padded key is concatenated with the intermediate hash value and hashed again using the same hash function. \n\n4. The final hash output is the HMAC value that can be used as a MAC for the message.\n\nThe padding, concatenation, and hashing steps help prevent cryptographic attacks and make it difficult to forge the HMAC without knowing the secret key. The use of a cryptographic hash function also provides collision resistance.\n\nIn summary, HMAC provides a way to authenticate the integrity and source of a message using a key and hash function.

Christian argues that as AI becomes more powerful, ensuring it behaves ethically and benefits humanity will become increasingly difficult. \n\nThe book examines different approaches to developing safe AI, such as reward hacking, inverse reinforcement learning, and capability control. Christian suggests that alignment may ultimately be an intractable problem, but argues we must continue striving to build AI that is trustworthy and aligned. \n\nThemes:\n\n- The difficulty of specifying human values - Christian argues that precisely defining beneficial goals for AI is enormously complex, as human values are nuanced, contextual and often contradictory.\n\n- The fragility of goals - Even if we can specify human-aligned goals, AI may exploit loopholes and edge cases in those goals to produce unintended and potentially dangerous behaviors. \n\n- The problem of corrigibility - How can we build AI systems that are open to feedback and correction by humans? Christian suggests current AI lacks corrigibility.\n\n- AI safety research - Christian surveys techniques like capability control, value learning and AI transparency that aim to produce safer, more aligned AI. But he is uncertain if these approaches can fully solve alignment.\n\n- Control vs. cooperation - Should we focus on building AI we can control, or AI we can cooperate with? Christian sees merits in both approaches.\n\nAnalysis:\n\nA key strength of the book is how accessibly it explains the technical challenges of alignment for a general audience. Christian effectively synthesizes a wide array of research on AI safety and ethics. His balanced perspective considers viewpoints from AI developers, philosophers and others.\n\nHowever, the book offers more diagnosis than solutions. Christian surveys proposed techniques for achieving alignment, but is ultimately skeptical they will be sufficient. Some critics argue the book could be more constructive in outlining paths forward. But Christian's sober assessment may temper unrealistic expectations about solving alignment.\n\nRelated reading:\n\n- Superintelligence by Nick Bostrom\n- Human Compatible by Stuart Russell \n- Artificial Intelligence: A Guide for Thinking Humans by Melanie Mitchell\n- Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark\n- Algorithms of Oppression by Safiya Umoja Noble", "token_len": 449}]}], "tstamp": 1713343486.1680748}

This results in two descent phases and an intermediate ascent phase in the curve of test error vs model complexity.\n\nThe key points about deep double descent are:\n\n- It typically occurs when training large neural networks and varying their size or number of parameters. The model complexity is proxy for capacity.\n\n- Initially, as model capacity increases, test error decreases. This is the first descent phase and is due to reduced underfitting. \n\n- Past a certain capacity, test error starts increasing again. This is the ascent phase and is due to increased overfitting as models become more flexible.\n\n- With even higher capacity, test error then starts decreasing again. This second descent is attributed to models being able to fit the training data sufficiently while regularization techniques like early stopping prevent high variance.\n\n- The double descent behavior demonstrates that high capacity models can generalize well despite overfitting, if properly regularized. The two descent phases illustrate how test error is impacted by both underfitting and overfitting.\n\nThis phenomenon is linked to gradient descent and early stopping in the following ways:\n\n- Gradient descent helps find optimal parameters during training for different model capacities. The impact of model capacity emerges clearly during this optimization process.\n\n- Early stopping regularization is key to controlling overfitting and enabling the second descent. It avoids models reaching their lowest training error so they do not overfit the training data.\n\nIn summary, deep double descent illustrates the complex interplay between model capacity, underfitting, overfitting, optimization techniques like gradient descent and regularization methods like early stopping that enables high capacity models to achieve low test error.", "token_len": 351}]}], "tstamp": 1713343980.5869365}

Lower frequencies like L-band (1-2 GHz) may be needed to detect shells at longer ranges due to less atmospheric attenuation.\n\n- Antenna size - Larger antennas provide higher gain for improved detection range. A phased array antenna could be used for electronic scanning without moving parts. Size needs to fit vehicle platform.\n\n- Waveform - Using pulse compression with phase-coded waveforms can improve range resolution compared to a simple pulse. Match filtering can be used to optimize detection.\n\n- Processing - Digital processing enables pulse compression and Doppler processing to discriminate shells from clutter. High speed processors are needed to perform real-time signal processing.\n\n- Scan pattern - Electronic scanning in elevation and mechanical scanning in azimuth may be suitable. Conical or helical scan patterns increase revisit rate over a sector.\n\n- Tracking - Once detected, monopulse angle tracking or sequential lobing could track the shell's flight. This can increase accuracy for fire control.\n\n- Power - Radar will require high power for long range, which can be achieved through klystron, TWT or solid state amplifiers. Power generation/cooling needs to fit vehicle.\n\n- System integration - Radar needs to be integrated with vehicle platform, power, cooling, navigation aids, fire control computer and user interfaces.

Transactional data has many records with fewer columns per record.\n\n- Check for unique identifiers like ID columns. Master data will usually have a unique identifier for each entity while transactional data often lacks unique IDs.\n\n- Assess the variability of values. Master data tends to have more static attributes for each entity while transactional data changes more frequently. I could calculate the percentage of distinct values per column as an indication.\n\n- Check for temporal attributes like dates, times or timestamps. Transactional data usually has temporal attributes to record events over time whereas master data does not. \n\n- Look for descriptive attributes versus quantitative attributes. Master data focuses more on descriptive attributes for each entity while transactional data tends to be more quantitative.\n\n- Sample the data and assess if records refer to distinct entities (master) or events/transactions (transactional).\n\n- Build a small classification model using the metadata and data samples as features to predict the dataset type.\n\nThe main goal is to assess if the dataset describes distinct entities in detail (master) or captures transactions/events involving those entities over time (transactional). Combining several strategies like summary statistics, visual inspection and machine learning models can help make this classification.", "token_len": 280}]}], "tstamp": 1713343780.7978873}

You can create the plot in a FigureCanvas and update it by calling plot.draw() on each new data point. Plotly may be more complex to set up for real-time plotting.\n\n- For the file chooser, QFileDialog can be used to select the save location. The file path can be displayed in a QLineEdit. \n\n- For recording the webcam, you can use VideoWriter to write the frames to a video file. Start and stop recording based on a toggle button state.\n\n- Using a QVBoxLayout with appropriate sizing policies and stretch factors can adapt the layout automatically. Set fixed heights on the buttons and text field.\n\n- PyQT works well on Linux.

Developing innovative technologies to improve critical mineral supply resilience is a national priority. There is an opportunity for collaboration between government, industry, academia, and nonprofits to establish a Critical Minerals Innovation Testbed focused on sustainably extracting critical minerals from mining waste. This testbed would develop and demonstrate technologies to reduce the environmental impacts of mining while creating domestic supplies of key minerals. \n\nThe Feasibility and Promise of Extracting from Mining Waste\n\nVast quantities of critical minerals are contained in mine waste tailings and rock piles. New technologies make it possible to extract these minerals. Tailings already contain concentrated minerals and have a reduced ore grade compared to virgin ore, lowering barriers to economic extraction. Additionally, reprocessing tailings reduces the need for new mines and associated environmental impacts. Pilot projects have shown success extracting rare earth elements and other critical minerals from tailings. With focused R&D and demonstrations, tailings reprocessing can become widespread.\n\nKey Technologies and Research Areas \n\nMany technologies show promise for economically and sustainably extracting critical minerals from mining waste. Some key areas include:\n\n- Sensor-based ore sorting and concentration technologies to separate minerals\n- Advanced mineral processing methods like froth flotation and leaching\n- Modular and mobile extraction units to minimize costs\n- Geospatial data analytics to identify high-grade deposits in waste\n- Machine learning for process optimization \n- Water recycling and treatment technologies to reduce usage and impacts\n- New environmentally-friendly solvents and extraction chemicals\n\nBringing together expertise across these areas in a testbed program would accelerate development. The testbed can start with laboratory R&D then progress to field demos at mine sites to show real-world viability.\n\nThe Opportunity for Collaboration  \n\nThere is an opportunity to bring together diverse organizations to lead critical mineral innovation. Mining companies can contribute industry knowledge, site access, data, and funding. Researchers can provide expertise in extraction processes, environmental science, data analytics, and more. Government agencies can offer guidance on priorities and funding support. Nonprofits can assemble consortiums, coordinate efforts, and engage communities. \n\nBy coming together in an innovation testbed, these groups can achieve shared goals around securing domestic mineral supplies, growing economic opportunity, and reducing environmental impacts. The testbed can serve as a model for public-private collaboration on national priorities.\n\nConclusion\n\nDeveloping technologies to extract critical minerals from mining waste provides benefits across sectors while advancing sustainability. There is tremendous opportunity for an innovation testbed program to demonstrate these technologies at commercial scale. By bringing together diverse expertise and resources, the testbed can generate innovative solutions to critical mineral supply chain challenges. This collaborative effort promises significant economic, security, and environmental returns for all partners as well as the nation.", "token_len": 583}]}], "tstamp": 1713344226.3429925}

This view controller is responsible for providing the UI that will be displayed in the keyboard view when the iMessage app is invoked. \n\nIn the view controller, you would add two UIButton instances and configure them with whatever titles or images you want for the two buttons.

The structuralist approach to teaching English emphasizes the systematic study of language structure and grammar over communicative function. Its strengths include providing students with a strong foundation in proper grammar, syntax, and mechanics. However, it has been criticized for overemphasizing rote memorization and repetition of structures, while neglecting creativity, student engagement, and real-world language use. The approach may work for older students who want to improve specific grammar skills, but younger learners would likely become bored and disengaged. Teachers must strike a balance between teaching proper form and allowing creative expression. Overall, structuralism provides an important but incomplete view of language. \n\n2. The Direct Method and the Grammar-Translation Method take opposing approaches to language teaching. The Direct Method focuses on using the target language inductively through conversational interaction and context cues. Grammar is taught implicitly, not explicitly. In contrast, the Grammar-Translation Method relies on deductive learning of grammar rules, translation of texts, and rote memorization. The Direct Method develops basic communication skills, while the Grammar-Translation Method provides more advanced grammatical knowledge. However, the Direct Method has been criticized for lack of efficiency and reliance on teachers' target language proficiency. The Grammar-Translation Method fails to develop real communicative abilities. An effective language teaching approach needs to balance meaningful interaction with explicit grammar instruction tailored to the students' level and goals.\n\n3. The Audio-Lingual Method declined in popularity due to its limitations and flaws. Critics argued it overemphasized memorization and repetition at the expense of creativity and authentic communication. Relying heavily on behaviorist theory, it treated language learning as habit formation, failing to account for learners' cognitive processes. Drilling dialogues based on contrived situations did not transfer well to real conversational skills. The method lacked a focus on communicative competence and gave students little autonomy. Effective language teaching requires meaningful interaction, integration of different skills, learner engagement, and development of communicative abilities, which the Audio-Lingual Method largely neglected. Its structural foundations could not withstand changes in learning theory and language teaching practices.\n\n4. Communicative Language Teaching (CLT) aims to develop \"communicative competence,\" which refers not just to grammatical competence but also to the ability to use language appropriately in social contexts. CLT addresses limitations of previous methods by using authentic materials, promoting interaction and communication, and integrating different language skills. Learners take an active role negotiating meaning through group work and communicating for real purposes. The teacher facilitates learning rather than directly transmitting knowledge. While no single method is definitive, CLT represents a major advancement by emphasizing the multifaceted nature of language and the interdependence of language and communication.", "token_len": 556}]}], "tstamp": 1713379725.9249403}

Strategies with higher initial skill probabilities get tested earlier.\n\n- Fallback procedure: Rank strategies by initial skill probabilities. Test them in order until you get the first rejection of the null. Then go back and test all strategies ranked above the first rejection.

The spells you learn are limited in scope to divination, enchantment, and illusion spells. You also learn additional spells as you gain levels in this class, as shown on the Cryptic Spells table. \n\nYou may use an arcane focus as a spellcasting focus for your cipher spells. Intelligence is your spellcasting ability for your cipher spells. You use your Intelligence whenever a spell refers to your spellcasting ability.\n\n**Bonded Mind:** Your mind is linked to an ally, allowing you to communicate telepathically. As a bonus action, you can designate an allied creature within 30 feet to be linked to your mind. While linked, you can communicate telepathically with that creature if it is within 120 feet. This link lasts for 10 minutes or until you use your bonus action to break the link or link to a different creature.\n\n**Mental Focus:** You gain proficiency with Wisdom saving throws.\n\n**Cipher Discipline:** At 3rd level, you choose a discipline that shapes the nature of your cipher magic: Mental Disruption, Mental Fortress, or Telepathic Strategist, all detailed at the end of the class description. Your discipline choice grants you features at 3rd level and again at 6th, 10th, 14th, and 18th level.\n\n**Ability Score Improvement:** At 4th, 8th, 12th, 16th, and 19th level you can increase one ability score of your choice by 2, or you can increase two ability scores of your choice by 1. You can't increase an ability score above 20 using this feature.\n\n**Mental Potency:** At 11th level, when you make an Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma saving throw, you can use your reaction to gain advantage on the roll. You can use this feature a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). You regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.\n\n**Living Mind:** At 20th level, your mind becomes diffuse and detached from your body. You are immune to any effect that would detect thoughts, discern lies, read your alignment, or detect your creature type. In addition, your thoughts and mind can't be read or discerned by telepathy or other means unless you allow it. You can use your action to suppress or restore this benefit.\n\n**Cipher Disciplines:**\n\n*Mental Disruption*\n3rd: Distracting Cacophony - As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes 3d8 psychic damage, and it can't take reactions until the end of its next turn. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and suffers no other effect. You can use this feature a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once).\n\n6th: Psychic Static - You gain resistance to psychic damage. In addition, when another creature deals psychic damage to you, you can use your reaction to force the creature to make a Wisdom saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature takes psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier. \n\n10th: Psychic Backlash - When you are targeted by a melee or ranged weapon attack, you can use your reaction to make a melee spell attack against the attacker, dealing 3d8 psychic damage on a hit. You can use this feature a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). \n\n14th: Psychic Onslaught - As an action, you unleash devastating psychic energy in a 30-foot cube within 120 feet. Each creature in the area must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC, taking 8d8 psychic damage on a failed save, or half as much on a successful one. You can use this feature once, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.\n\n18th: Psychic Annihilation - When you deal psychic damage to a creature, you can force it to make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, the creature's Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1 until the end of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once).\n\n*Mental Fortress* \n3rd: Fortified Mind - You have advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws against magic.\n\n6th: Thought Shield - As a reaction when you take damage, you can gain resistance to that damage type until the end of your next turn. You can use this feature a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once). \n\n10th: Iron Will - You have advantage on saving throws against being charmed or frightened. If you succeed on a saving throw against being charmed or frightened, you suffer no effect and the creature that forced the saving throw can't use the same effect on you for 24 hours.\n\n14th: Mental Barrier - As an action, you create a 30-foot radius sphere of protective psychic energy centered on yourself. Choose any number of creatures within the sphere. Until the start of your next turn, each chosen creature gains resistance to psychic damage and advantage on Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma saving throws. This effect ends early if you are incapacitated. You can use this feature once, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.  \n\n18th: Adamantine Mind - You are immune to psychic damage and any effect that would reduce your Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma scores or deal psychic damage.\n\n*Telepathic Strategist*\n3rd: Telepathic Tactics - As a bonus action, you grant one willing creature you can communicate with telepathically the ability to add your Intelligence modifier (minimum of +1) to attack rolls, ability checks, and saving throws for 1 minute. You can use this feature a number of times per day equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum of once).\n\n6th: Read Thoughts - As an action, choose one creature you can see within 60 feet. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw against your spell save DC. On a failed save, you can read the target's surface thoughts for 1 minute, during which time you have advantage on Wisdom (Insight) and Charisma (Deception, Intimidation, Persuasion) checks against the target. On a successful save, the target is unaffected and you can't use this feature against it again until you finish a long rest.\n\n10th: Psychic Redirection - When a creature makes an attack roll against you, you can use your reaction to impose disadvantage on the roll. If the attack still hits, the attacker takes psychic damage equal to your Intelligence modifier.  \n\n14th: Psychic Switch - As a reaction when an ally within 60 feet of you is hit by an attack, you can swap places with that creature, teleporting to each other's positions. The attack then targets you instead. You can use this feature once, regaining the ability to do so when you finish a long rest.\n\n18th: Supreme Strategy - As an action, you can project your consciousness to a location you are familiar with on the same plane of existence. Your body remains in a trance until your consciousness returns. You perceive and can take actions at the projected location as if you were there, using your Intelligence, Wisdom, Charisma, and class features. This effect lasts for 1 hour or until your concentration is broken (as if concentrating on a spell). Once you use this feature, you can't use it again until you finish a long rest.", "token_len": 2702}]}], "tstamp": 1713344255.3250148}

It became the standard title for Egyptian rulers for the next 3,000 years.\n\n- In the Egyptian language, it was written as pr-aa and later as \ud80c\ude50\ud80c\ude7b pr-\u02bf3 (\"great house\") in hieroglyphs. It was vocalized as \"pharaoh\" in Greek and then entered other languages.\n\n- The term meant the king who owned all of Egypt. Pharaohs were considered god-kings with absolute power over the land and people.

The extra gluten will make the wet dough easier to handle.\n\n- Let the dough ferment and develop for a longer time. At least 3-4 hours, but ideally 8-12 hours if you can refrigerate it overnight. This allows the gluten to fully develop and strengthen.\n\n- Fold the dough during the fermentation period. Every 30-60 minutes, give the dough a turn, fold the sides into the middle, and press it down gently. This builds gluten strength.\n\n- Shape gently and slowly. Don't degass the dough too much. Shape it by gently flattening it and then rolling/stretching it out on the table. Let it relax 5-10 minutes between shaping steps. \n\n- For the final shape, create tension by gently pulling the ends as you roll the dough. Place it seam side up in the proofing basket or towel lined bowl.\n\n- Proof the shaped dough at room temperature until puffy, usually 1-2 hours. The final proof should be gentle so the shape holds.\n\n- Use a razor to make 3-4 angled slashes along the top before baking. This will guide the expansion.\n\n- Bake at high heat, 475F+ to set the shape before oven spring.

The joint is swollen, red, and exquisitely tender.\n\n- Septic arthritis - Bacterial infection of the joint space can cause similar symptoms to gout. The toe would be warm, red, swollen, and painful. Fever may also be present.\n\n- Cellulitis - A bacterial skin infection could cause swelling, redness, and pain of the toe. It would be diffuse rather than focused on the joint space. Fever and other constitutional symptoms may be present.\n\n- Bunion - Enlargement and inflammation of the joint at the base of the big toe. May cause swelling, redness and pain, but not to the same extreme degree as gout. Gradual onset rather than sudden.\n\n- Trauma - Any recent injury to the toe could cause pain, swelling and redness. There may be a history of trauma.\n\n- Erythromelalgia - Rare disorder causing episodes of red, hot, swollen extremities. May involve toes.\n\n- Rheumatoid arthritis - Autoimmune arthritis may initially present in one joint, such as the big toe.

As variables are assigned, add a comment with the original variables used to derive it. For example `x = y + z # derived from y and z`. Then search for the output variable to find all mentions of its origins.\n\n- Use static analysis to generate data flow graphs.

Here is an explanation using a real life example:\n\nLet's imagine you are planning a trip and need to book flights, reserve a hotel, and rent a car. Each of these steps involves effects - the flight booking could fail if seats are unavailable, the hotel reservation could fail if rooms are booked up, etc. \n\nWe can model each step as a monadic computation:\n\n- The flight booking function would take your travel dates as input and return a FlightBooking monad. This encapsulates the fact that booking could fail.\n\n- The hotel reservation function would take your travel dates and destination as input and return a HotelReservation monad. Again, this encapsulates the possibility of failure.\n\n- The car rental function would take your travel dates and destination as input and return a CarRental monad.\n\nTo chain these together in a modular way, we use monadic bind (>>= in Haskell):\n\nbookTrip dates dest = \n  bookFlight dates >>= \\flight ->\n  reserveHotel dates dest >>= \\hotel ->\n  rentCar dates dest\n\nThe bind operator sequences the steps, passing the result of one computation to the next. But it also handles the effects - if any step fails (returns a \"failure\" monad value), the chain short circuits and the overall result is failure.\n\nSo monads allow us to chain computational steps while encapsulating effects like failure in a modular way. The same approach is used for other effects like IO, nondeterminism, etc. This is how monads enable modular and reusable effectful computation in Haskell.", "token_len": 329}]}], "tstamp": 1713344220.6079872}

More cores allows parallelizing inference.\n\n- RAM: 64GB or more of DDR4 RAM with fast speeds like 3600MHz. Models require lots of memory.\n\n- Storage: PCIe 4.0 NVMe SSD storage, at least 2TB. Fast storage reduces load times.\n\n- Motherboard: X570 or Z690 chipset motherboard to provide full PCIe 4.0 support.\n\n- PSU: 1000W or higher power supply to feed the power hungry GPU/CPU. \n\n- Cooling: AIO liquid cooler for the CPU and ample fans to cool the GPU. LLM inference generates lots of heat.\n\nThe most important factors are the GPU, getting the highest VRAM capacity you can, and cooling.

Foundation - Concrete workers pour the concrete foundation. This provides a stable base to build upon. \n\n3. Framing - Carpenters build the wooden frame of the house including floors, walls and roof. The frame provides the structure and shape of the house.\n\n4. Roofing - Roofers install the roof including shingles, flashing and gutters. The roof must go on early to protect the interior from weather.\n\n5. Plumbing - Plumbers install all water and sewer pipes and fixtures. Plumbing goes in early while walls are open for access.\n\n6. HVAC - Heating/cooling contractors install furnace, ducts, vents and air conditioning. HVAC requires open walls and ceilings for running ductwork. \n\n7. Electrical - Electricians wire the entire house and install fixtures and outlets. Wiring needs open walls and coordinated with plumbing and HVAC.\n\n8. Insulation - Insulation contractors fill walls, floors and ceilings to regulate temperature. Insulation requires the major mechanicals to be installed first.\n\n9. Drywall - Drywall installers hang, tape and mud drywall throughout. Drywall goes up after major mechanicals are installed and inspected.\n\n10. Flooring - Hardwood, tile and carpet layers install finished floors. Flooring is one of the last trades after walls/ceilings are finished. \n\n11. Painting - Painters prime and paint interior and exterior surfaces. Painting is done after most other trades are finished to avoid damage.\n\n12. Trim - Carpenters install interior trim, cabinets, doors and railings. Trimwork is done later to avoid damage from other trades.\n\n13.

There are several key ethical considerations that should be made during the research process:\n\nAnonymity and Confidentiality of Data\n- The anonymity and confidentiality of research participants should be protected. Any identifying information about participants should be removed from the data and replaced with codes or pseudonyms. Data should be stored securely and only made available to those directly involved in the research. Participants should give informed consent to take part and be made aware of how their data will be used. \n\nAvoiding Bias \n- Researchers should be aware of their own biases and preconceived notions and ensure these do not influence the research design, data collection, or analysis. Leading questions should be avoided in surveys and interviews. Data analysis and reporting of findings should be objective and transparent. Researchers should report findings fully without omitting or downplaying results that contradict expectations or hypotheses.\n\nInformed Consent\n- Participants should be fully informed about the nature and purpose of the research and consent to participating without coercion. Deception should be avoided unless absolutely necessary and ethically justified. Participants have the right to withdraw at any time.\n\nAppropriate Research Design\n- The research design should follow ethical principles and avoid putting participants at undue risk. Any potential harm to participants should be minimized. Vulnerable groups require special ethical considerations. The benefits of the research should outweigh any risks or burdens to participants.\n\nAvoiding Plagiarism\n- Researchers must properly credit and cite the work of others. Passing off others' work as one's own constitutes plagiarism and is unethical. Data, theories, and findings from the literature should be properly referenced.\n\nEthical Oversight\n- Many institutions require oversight of research by an ethics review board or institutional review board (IRB) to ensure it meets ethical guidelines before being conducted. Researchers should comply with the required oversight procedures.\n\nAdhering to these ethical practices throughout the research process upholds scientific integrity and helps ensure that research is conducted responsibly. Researchers have an ethical obligation to minimize harm, avoid bias, properly credit sources, maintain confidentiality, and respect the rights of participants.\n\nReferences:\n\n[1] Resnik, D. B.

Adjust the final fully-connected layers for your specific radiology classification/triage tasks.\n\n- Train the model using stochastic gradient descent with momentum. Monitor validation loss to prevent overfitting. Augment training data with rotations, flips, zooms, etc for more diversity.\n\n- For deployment, set up a DICOM server to receive images from your hospital PACS system. Write a script to preprocess each image and run inference on the trained model to generate triage predictions. \n\n- Output the predictions to a database table that can be accessed by your radiologist workflow software. Make sure to include the original image ID so predictions can be matched back to the correct studies.\n\n- Monitor model performance in production - track prediction accuracy, latency, errors. Retrain periodically on new data to maintain performance. Make sure radiologists can provide feedback on predictions to further improve the model.\n\n- For the PACS system itself, work with your IT department to integrate the DICOM server, database and front-end software.

You can enable intra-op parallelism by setting the number of threads in the session options. This will allow multiple threads to execute different nodes in the graph simultaneously.\n\n- Optimize model - Simplify the model architecture, reduce number of layers/operations, prune unnecessary connections to make the model lighter and faster. Use quantization or lower precision (FP16/INT8) if possible.\n\n- Build with performance optimization - Enable compiler optimizations like vectorization, multi-threading etc. Build OpenCV/ONNX with NEON/ARM optimizations for ARM CPUs.\n\n- Affinity setting - Set CPU affinity to restrict ONNX threads to specific cores. This ensures threads are not migrated across cores and improves cache utilization.\n\n- CPU Governor - Use a higher performance CPU governor like 'performance' instead of default 'ondemand'. This will allow CPU to run at max frequency for performance.\n\n- Thread priority - Increase thread priority of ONNX runtime threads via setpriority() or nice value. Higher priority threads get more CPU cycles.\n\n- Disable CPU throttling - Disable CPU throttling features like big.LITTLE that scale down CPU speeds to ensure consistent high performance.\n\n- Model batching - Increase model batch size to leverage SIMD/vectorization.

Create functions to generate and format invoices. This includes things like creating a new invoice, adding line items, calculating totals, and formatting the invoice into a printable format.\n\n3. Store invoice data. Decide if you will store the invoices locally in a file, database, etc. or have some API for managing invoice data.\n\n4. Create user interface. This could be a simple command line interface that allows creating, viewing, and searching invoices. Or you could create a graphical UI with Tkinter, PyQt etc. \n\n5. Add additional features. Such as loading invoice templates, emailing invoices, generating PDFs, recurring invoices, reporting, charts, etc.\n\n6. Write tests. Add unit tests for the core functionality using Python's unittest module.\n\n7. Handle errors and exceptions. Use try/except blocks to handle potential errors gracefully.\n\n8. Refactor and improve. Go back and clean up code, optimize performance, improve interfaces, etc.\n\nSo in summary:\n\n- Model invoice data  \n- CRUD invoice functions  \n- Storage for invoices  \n- User interface for app  \n- Additional features as desired  \n- Writing tests\n- Handling errors and exceptions\n- Refactoring and improving\n\nThe key is to start simple and incrementally add functionality.

The peculiar odor and unique taste of durian have made it one of the most prized fruits worldwide. Durian trees flower and fruit seasonally, with flowering typically induced by environmental cues such as temperature, rainfall, solar radiation and soil moisture. Understanding the environmental factors that trigger flowering in durian is crucial for improving productivity and ensuring stable fruit yields. \n\nThis study aims to elucidate the impacts of climate and soil conditions on floral induction in durian. While previous studies have provided some insights into durian phenology, knowledge gaps remain regarding the interactions between meteorological factors and soil properties in controlling durian flowering. Here, we take a data-driven approach to systematically investigate how temperature, rainfall, humidity, solar radiation and soil moisture influence the timing and intensity of durian flowering across major growing regions. \n\nThe specific objectives are: 1) to analyze long-term climatic and soil data in relation to durian flowering patterns derived from field observations and remote sensing, 2) to develop statistical models to identify key climate and soil parameters that trigger durian floral induction, and 3) to generate data-driven insights to guide management practices for optimizing durian flowering and productivity. \n\nThis research will provide a comprehensive understanding of environmental control over durian reproductive phenology. The data-driven models and insights from this study can be used to forecast flowering periods, adapt crop management to local climate and soil conditions, and aid climate change adaptation to sustain durian fruit yields. Overall, the findings will be invaluable for improving productivity and resilience of durian orchards across diverse agro-ecological environments.", "token_len": 362}]}], "tstamp": 1713343719.4623954}

This will get rid of the lines while smoothing out the image.\n\n5. Use a horizontal opening operation (erosion followed by dilation) with a small horizontal structuring element. This will remove thin lines while preserving the overall structure.\n\nSo in summary, detect the lines using filtering, connected components or morphological operations - then mask out the lines or interpolate across them to remove them.

Context helps, but some ambiguity remains. Capturing audio in a noisy environment also makes analysis harder.\n\n- The analysis involves techniques like machine learning and signal processing to match audio features to likely keys.

It allows us to write programs that can manipulate other programs, essentially treating code itself as just another form of data that can be passed around and operated on.\n\nTo understand this, let's start with some basic Scheme examples. In Scheme, functions are just regular data values that can be bound to variables or passed to other functions:\n\n```scheme\n(define (add x y)\n  (+ x y))\n\n(define my-function add)\n```\n\nHere we've defined a simple add function and bound it to the variable 'my-function'. So far nothing special. But now consider this:\n\n```scheme \n(define (apply-func func arg)\n  (func arg))\n\n(apply-func my-function 10)\n```\n\nWe've defined a higher-order function 'apply-func' that takes another function 'func' as an input. It then calls that input function, treating it as data. This is an example of \"programs as data\" - we are passing a function itself as data to another function.\n\nWe can take this further by writing functions that take functions as input and return new functions as output:\n\n```scheme\n(define (make-adder num)\n  (lambda (x) (+ x num)))\n\n(define add-10 (make-adder 10))\n\n(add-10 20) ; returns 30\n```\n\nHere 'make-adder' takes a number and returns a new function tailored to add that number to its input. The power of \"programs as data\" is on full display here.\n\nIn summary, Scheme allows us to treat code like any other data by letting us pass functions as arguments, return functions from other functions, and build new functions programmatically. This enables very expressive and abstract software through higher-order functions. That is the essence of \"programs as data\".\n\nI hope this step-by-step introduction helps explain this key concept in functional programming!

The heated grips contain an electrical heating element that is activated by the rider through a switch. The heating element is powered by the vehicle's electrical system and control electronics that regulate the temperature. \n\nA common problem with heated grips is undercurrent faults, where the current flowing through the heating element is lower than expected. This can happen due to failures in the heating element, wiring faults, or problems with the control electronics. Without proper fault detection, the grips may not heat up sufficiently, leading to rider discomfort.\n\nExisting systems rely on directly measuring the current flow using a current sensor or shunt resistor. The measured current is compared to a threshold to detect undercurrent faults. However, adding current measurement hardware increases cost and complexity. The current sense components also introduce electrical noise that can interfere with the operation of the heating element control electronics.\n\nTherefore, there is a need for a system that can detect undercurrent faults in heated grips without requiring additional current measurement hardware. The proposed invention aims to address this need with a novel approach to detect undercurrent conditions based on the duty cycle of the heating element control signal.", "token_len": 277}]}], "tstamp": 1713379615.5523474}

Defenses: Signature checking/verification of the binary before running it.\n\n2. Patch at runtime: The attacker could patch the running process memory to flip PIN_ENTRY_ENABLED to true. Defenses: Memory protections like NX bit, ASLR, canaries.\n\n3. Exploit buffer overflow: The save_data function has a potential buffer overflow which could be exploited to overwrite PIN_ENTRY_ENABLED. Defenses: Use safe Rust types like String instead of raw pointers. Input validation.  \n\n4. Supply invalid menu option: The get_option() function doesn't properly validate input, an attacker could supply an out of range option to bypass the menu. Defenses: Better input validation of menu options.\n\n5. Binary exploitation: Memory corruption or other vulnerabilities may allow executing arbitrary code to bypass the menu. Defenses: Proper auditing and fuzzing to find and fix exploitable bugs. Enable mitigations like DEP, ASLR.\n\n6. Access the config file directly: An attacker may be able to directly access the config file without needing the panel.

The merchant has to have a direct relationship with the acquirer.

Having the verifier evaluate and select the best solution allows for error correction.\n\n- Framing verification as a simpler task than generation is a reasonable claim.

Understanding the diversity and breadth of options impacts the verifier's effectiveness.\n\n- There is no evidence provided to support the claim that verification is often a simpler task than generation.

Sample points along the path, move them based on the gradient towards free space.\n\n- Precompute a distance field from the radiance field. Then do standard pathfinding on the distance field using jump flooding or fast marching methods.\n\n- Build a signed distance field from the radiance field. Then use it to attract agents towards a goal and repel them from obstacles. This gives you a potential field to follow.\n\n- Sample the radiance field in a sphere around the agent. Use the samples to construct a local navigation mesh. Run pathfinding on that to get a local steering direction.\n\nThe key is to sample the radiance field, either directly or through a derived distance/SDF field, in order to get occupancy and distance values.

Increase the maximum context length setting for the model if possible. For example, some models support increasing the context length to 4096 or more tokens. \n\n3. Shorten the messages by removing unnecessary content to reduce the total number of tokens. Simplify long sentences, remove repetitive content etc.\n\n4. Preprocess the messages before sending to the model to reduce the number of tokens. This could include stemming, lemmatization, removing stop words etc.\n\n5. Store context in a database or cache between messages rather than passing all context directly in each message. This can help reduce the tokens per message.\n\n6. Use a different model architecture that supports longer context lengths like Longformer or Reformer models.\n\n7. Truncate the messages to 2048 tokens before sending to the model.

Rewrite the messages to be more concise and use fewer tokens to convey the same information.\n\nSo in summary, the key fixes are splitting messages, simplifying content, increasing context capacity, preprocessing text, storing context externally, switching models or truncating messages.

This may miss some dynamic content.\n\n- Use proxies/rotation - Using proxies and rotating them can help avoid getting blocked while scraping certain sites.

Use `int()` or `float()` to convert and catch exceptions.\n\n- For any inputs that allow arbitrary strings, use `ast.literal_eval()` to safely evaluate the input rather than using `eval()`. \n\n- Use a whitelist approach when possible. For example check that an input matches an expected set of options rather than trying to blacklist all bad cases.\n\n- Use subprocess with the `shell=False` argument to prevent shell injection from inputs.\n\n- In general, validate and sanitize all inputs even if they seem harmless.

However, many chatbots use limited hardcoded responses that lack the ability to understand context and have natural conversations. We propose developing a next-generation dynamic chatbot using GenAI that can have more intelligent and natural conversations.\n\nAbout GenAI\n\nGenAI is an artificial intelligence system developed by Anthropic to power conversational agents. It uses a technique called constitutional AI to have safe conversations and maintain common sense. Key benefits of GenAI include:\n\n- Understanding context and nuance - GenAI can understand the context of conversations and respond appropriately instead of giving scripted responses. This allows for more natural conversations.\n\n- Dynamic generation - Responses are generated dynamically instead of being hardcoded. This allows the chatbot to have millions of potential responses tailored to the specific conversation.\n\n- Improved over time - GenAI chatbots can improve through continued training on conversational data to handle a wider range of topics and questions.\n\n- Customizable - GenAI provides tools to customize the chatbot's personality and tone to match a brand.\n\nBenefits for Clients\n\nSwitching to a GenAI-powered chatbot would provide the following benefits:\n\n- Increased customer satisfaction - More intelligent conversations lead to better customer experiences and satisfaction.\n\n- Reduced customer support costs - Automating more conversations with customers can reduce the workload for human agents.\n\n- Scalability - A GenAI chatbot can handle increasing customers and conversations without needing to scale up human support staff.\n\n- New marketing channel - Chatbots provide a new marketing and engagement channel to interact with prospects and customers.\n\n- Data insights - Conversation data can provide useful insights into customer needs, pain points, and trends.\n\n- Competitive advantage - Early adoption of an advanced AI chatbot solution will give a competitive edge over companies still using outdated chatbot technology.\n\nProposed Solution\n\nWe propose developing a chatbot powered by GenAI that can handle a variety of customer service and conversational scenarios. Key features will include:\n\n- Integration with your existing systems like CRM, databases, and ticketing systems to access customer data.\n\n- Ability to escalate complex conversations to a human agent.\n\n- Ongoing training program with human oversight to improve the chatbot's capabilities over time. \n\n- Customizable personality that matches your brand voice and tone.\n\n- User-friendly admin dashboard to manage the chatbot and view conversation analytics.\n\n- Deployment on your website, mobile app, messaging platforms, and popular voice assistants. \n\nWe estimate it will take 6-8 weeks to develop an initial production-ready chatbot. Ongoing improvements and training will expand the scope of supported conversational topics over time. We are excited at the opportunity to innovate together and implement a next-generation conversational experience for your customers.\n\nNext Steps\n\nIf you are interested in moving forward, the next steps would be to have a call to discuss your use cases and requirements in more detail, after which we can provide a more accurate timeline and cost estimate. We look forward to discussing how GenAI can help improve your customer engagement.", "token_len": 633}]}], "tstamp": 1713343979.2512357}

Report the capacity estimate as a range rather than a single number.\n\n- Perform risk analysis using Monte Carlo simulation to assign probability distributions to the uncertainties and determine the likelihood of capacity being within a certain range.\n\n- As you gather real data over time, refine your capacity model to reduce uncertainties. Track differences between estimates and actuals.\n\n- Communicate to stakeholders that initial capacity plans involve assumptions due to lack of data, and plans will be refined as more data is gathered. Provide ranges and risk metrics rather than point estimates.

STP stands for Segmentation, Targeting, and Positioning. \n\nSegmentation involves dividing a broad consumer market into sub-groups of consumers with common needs, behaviors, and characteristics. An example is Coca-Cola segmenting the beverage market into groups like energy drink consumers, health conscious consumers, soda drinkers, etc.\n\nTargeting is the process of evaluating each market segment to decide which ones to pursue. An example is Nike targeting athletes and sports enthusiasts for its shoes and apparel. Nike focuses marketing on this segment that has an interest and need for athletic gear.\n\nPositioning refers to how a brand is perceived relative to competitors. An example is Volvo positioning its vehicles as super safe compared to other cars. Volvo has built a brand reputation around safety to differentiate in the auto market.  \n\nIn summary, the STP model helps companies identify the most viable customer segments, choose which to target, and determine how to position their brand in those target markets. By researching consumer demographics, psychographics, and needs, firms can better align their products, pricing, and messaging to appeal to the selected segments. The STP framework is an essential strategic marketing tool.", "token_len": 259}]}], "tstamp": 1713344139.4938943}

For example, you could provide a random nonce that must be included in the hash input.

If the current price is higher than your average cost, you have an unrealized gain. If it's lower, you have an unrealized loss. \n\n- For realized gains/losses, compare the sale price of shares sold to the average cost basis. If you sold shares for more than the average cost, it's a realized gain. If you sold for less, it's a realized loss.\n\n- Track gains/losses for each purchase. This requires keeping detailed records, but can provide more insight into how each buy performed. Compare the purchase price to the current price for unrealized gains/losses.\n\n- Use Excel or portfolio tracking tools. Spreadsheets and online/app tools make it easier to track cost basis, purchase dates, sale prices, and calculate profits or losses both for the entire position and each transaction.\n\n- Remember to consider dividends.

If the function tries to use more memory than allocated, it will be killed. Allocating more memory allows the function to process larger workloads without running out of memory.\n\n- Memory usage - Inefficient use of memory in the function code can lead to higher memory usage, reducing available memory for the workload. This can cause the function to hit memory limits faster. Optimizing memory usage in the code helps improve performance.\n\n- Garbage collection - Node.js uses garbage collection to free up memory that's no longer being used. GC runs periodically and can pause execution while it frees memory. With higher memory allocation, GC runs less frequently, reducing pauses. Lower memory allocation can increase GC overhead.\n\n- Caching - Node.js can cache application data and modules in memory to improve performance. With more memory, more caching can be done to improve performance. Insufficient memory leads to less caching.\n\n- Memory bandwidth - Lambda functions get proportional memory bandwidth based on the memory allocation.

To account for day of week patterns, the system could calculate separate statistics (mean, standard deviation, percentiles etc.) for each day of the week. The alerting thresholds would then be based on the relevant day's statistics rather than overall statistics.\n\n2. To handle overall trends in execution time, the system could use a weighted/exponential moving average rather than a simple overall average. This gives more weight to recent data and adapts to changes in the trend. The standard deviation and percentiles can be calculated relative to the moving average.\n\n3. For sudden jumps in execution time, the system could detect these by looking for outliers relative to recent data. For example, it could trigger an alert if the execution time is 3 standard deviations above the moving average. Alternatively, simple rules could be defined, like \"alert if execution time increases by more than 50% versus the past 7 days\".\n\n4. The system could combine both absolute thresholds (like 3 standard deviations from moving average) and relative thresholds (50% increase) to detect both sudden spikes and gradual trends.\n\n5. The window of data used to calculate the statistics and thresholds could also be adjusted based on the frequency and volatility of changes observed. A shorter window will adapt faster but be less stable.\n\n6. The alerting thresholds could be manually tuned over time as needed, based on observed false positives and false negatives.\n\n7. Additional metrics like job input data volumes could also be monitored to better contextualize execution time changes.\n\nThe key is to leverage statistical techniques while also building in flexibility to adapt to evolving data patterns and changes over time.

However, I can summarize some of the key positions and potential tensions between Republican policies on abortion access and social safety net programs aimed at children:\n\n- Many Republicans advocate restricting or banning abortion, arguing that life begins at conception and should be protected. At the same time, some Republican policies seek to limit or reduce government assistance programs that support children in poverty. \n\n- Critics argue this is contradictory - if life is sacred from conception, they contend more should be done to support impoverished children once they are born. Republicans may counter that private charity or family responsibility should substitute.\n\n- Republican views on abortion are often rooted in religious belief. But some note that major religions also emphasize compassion and care for the poor and vulnerable. This creates potential tension between anti-abortion values and limited government assistance.\n\n- Republicans tend to favor local or private solutions over federal programs. But critics argue vital services like food, healthcare and education need government's scale and resources, especially for low-income families.\n\n- There are debates over which policies best promote life, family stability, and child well-being. But reasonable people can thoughtfully disagree on where to draw the lines between individual, community, private sector and government responsibilities.\n\nIn summary, there are good faith arguments on all sides of these complex issues.

Check the manufacturer's website for new firmware versions.\n\n- Use WPA2 encryption - Use the WPA2 encryption protocol, which is more secure than WEP. Make sure to use a strong wifi password. \n\n- Disable WPS - The WPS feature makes it easy to connect devices but can be a security risk. Disable WPS if you are not using it.\n\n- Disable remote administration - Remote administration allows you to configure the router from the internet. Disable this and only allow changes from your local network.\n\n- Use a firewall - Enable the router's built-in firewall to filter incoming and outgoing traffic. Or use a third-party firewall for more robust protection.\n\n- Change the SSID - Don't broadcast the default SSID. Change it to something unique to make your network less visible.\n\n- Use MAC filtering - Configure MAC filtering to limit which devices can connect to your network based on their MAC addresses.\n\n- Set up a guest network - If you allow guests, set up a separate guest network to keep your main network more secure.\n\n- Position the router properly - Place the router in a central area and away from exterior walls for better security.", "token_len": 296}]}], "tstamp": 1713379806.3048694}

While these laws are regulated at the state level, there are some common features across most states. However, there are also key differences in workers' comp regulations from state to state that employers need to be aware of. This guide examines some of the most important state-specific workers' comp regulations for employers.\n\nBasic Workers\u2019 Comp Coverage\n\nAll states except Texas require most employers to carry workers' compensation insurance or qualify as self-insured (1). This coverage provides employees with medical treatment, lost wage replacement, and vocational rehabilitation services for workplace injuries and occupational diseases. Workers' comp insurance rates and premiums are based on factors like the risk level of the business, employee payroll, and claims history.\n\nState-Specific Rules and Requirements  \n\nWhile the core purpose of workers\u2019 comp is similar nationwide, many key regulations can vary significantly depending on the state (2). Some major areas of difference include:\n\n- Coverage exemptions - Some states exempt very small employers, certain industries, and independent contractors from mandatory coverage. The exemption rules differ widely among states.\n\n- Benefits - The amount and duration of disability and death benefits paid to injured workers or their survivors is regulated state-by-state. Some states pay higher wage replacement rates or have unlimited benefit duration.\n\n- Medical care - States have different rules regarding the selection of treating physicians, limits on medical treatment, and reimbursement rates for healthcare services. \n\n- Disputes - Each state has its own system for resolving disputed claims between injured workers and employers/insurers. Some states rely on administrative law judges while others use the regular court system.\n\n- Premiums - The formula for calculating workers' comp insurance premiums varies by state. Factors like claims experience, payroll, and risk classification are weighted differently.\n\n- Coverage for cumulative trauma - Some states require coverage for gradual onset injuries like repetitive strain while others do not. Carpal tunnel syndrome is an example.\n\n- Return to work - States have different criteria for determining when an injured employee can return to work in transitional duty or light duty roles.\n\nNavigating State Regulations\n\nGiven the complexities of varying state laws, it is essential for multi-state employers to understand the workers' comp requirements applicable to each jurisdiction where they have staff (3). Some tips for navigating state regulations:\n\n- Review the unique laws for each state of operation. Consult the state's department of labor or industrial relations division for resources.\n\n- Work closely with your workers\u2019 comp insurance carrier to ensure appropriate coverage is in place. Discuss any compliance questions.\n\n- Classify your employees carefully within each state's system for setting premiums. Incorrect classification can increase costs.\n\n- Document injuries properly and follow state-specific rules for providing medical care. \n\n- Report claims to your insurer right away and cooperate fully with state processes for dispute resolution if needed.\n\n- Train supervisors on return-to-work procedures compliant with each state's standards. Improper procedures can increase costs or lead to penalties.\n\n- Consult an attorney experienced in workers\u2019 comp law for guidance on multi-state compliance issues.\n\nSome examples of specific state regulations include:\n\n- Florida's statutory benefits are among the most generous while Indiana's are among the stingiest (1).\n\n- In California, claims for cumulative trauma like carpal tunnel are compensable under workers' comp (4). \n\n- Texas employers can opt out of the workers' comp system but still must provide equivalent benefits (5).\n\n- Wisconsin sets minimum permanency thresholds for permanent partial disability benefits (6). \n\n- In Pennsylvania, employers must accept a physician chosen by the employee from a designated provider list (7).\n\nProactive Compliance \n\nStaying on top of varying state regulations is key for employers with staff around the country. Non-compliance can lead to gaps in employee coverage, financial penalties, and increased insurance costs.

Enable automatic updates if possible.\n\n- Use an antivirus program and keep it updated. Windows Defender is decent for basic protection.\n\n- Use a firewall to block unwanted network connections. The Windows firewall is suitable for basic needs.\n\n- Be careful when downloading software and don't install anything unnecessary. Only download from trusted sources.\n\n- Make regular backups of important data either to an external drive or cloud storage.\n\n- Enable full disk encryption using BitLocker or a third party tool to secure data.\n\n- Consider using a password manager to generate and store strong unique passwords.\n\n- For development, install tools like Visual Studio, Git, Python, etc. Use Chocolatey to simplify installs.\n\n- Clone any GitHub repos you need to a development folder, not in typical user folders.\n\n- Use Visual Studio to write, debug, and test code then commit and push to GitHub. \n\n- Learn to use the command line, Powershell, and tools like Git Bash for additional flexibility.\n\n- Carefully consider permissions when sharing code or data with others. Use SSH keys where possible.\n\n- Validate input data and sanitize output when developing applications to prevent security issues.\n\n- Keep development and production environments separate if deploying any apps you build.\n\nLet me know if you need any clarification or have additional questions!", "token_len": 321}]}], "tstamp": 1713343769.6367881}
